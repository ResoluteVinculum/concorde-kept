# [Sphinx of Secrets](Rules\Source\bestiary\celestial/sphinx-of-secrets-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 292*  

Sphinxes of secrets are commonly associated with a site of great magic or learning. These immortal beings often outlive such locations, though, and might protect a site's ruins as they continue their own studies. Sphinxes of secrets fiercely guard their dwellings and research.

## Sphinxes

*Collectors and Keepers of Secrets*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Planar (Upper Planes)  
- **Treasure.** [[Rules/Source/tables/random-magic-items-arcana\|Arcana]]  

Sphinxes protect the secrets of the multiverse. Formed from the spirits of sages and explorers, sphinxes know the power of truth and the importance of preserving it. They share their wisdom only with those who prove themselves wise or overcome tests of worthiness, such as riddles or battles with dangerous beasts. Through their existences, sphinxes might change form as they gain more nuanced understanding of cosmic enigmas.

### Sphinx Lairs

Sphinxes typically dwell in places that hold great knowledge or prophetic magic.

## Glabrezu

*Demon of Delusion and Entrapment*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** [[Rules/Source/tables/random-magic-items-relics\|Relics]]  

Glabrezus embody delusion and predatory guile. These cunning demons know the most effective traps are those that individuals devise for themselves. Despite having massive claws and overwhelming physicality, glabrezus excel at using flattery and misdirection to coerce victims into isolating themselves and harming others.

In the Abyss, glabrezus act as lone hunters or deceitful advisers to greater demons. Glabrezus seek routes to the Material Plane and relish being summoned by magic-users. They eagerly serve mortals while tempting them to betray their allies and indulge in hubristic fantasies. A glabrezu strives to murder its summoner once the magic-user has committed irredeemable misdeeds and the mortal's soul is surely condemned to the Abyss.

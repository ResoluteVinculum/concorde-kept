# [Drow Matron Mother](Rules\Source\bestiary\humanoid/drow-matron-mother-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 104*  

Among drow followers of Lolth, each noble house is led by a matron mother, an influential priestess of Lolth charged with carrying out the god's will while also advancing the interests of the family. Matron mothers embody the scheming and treachery associated with the Queen of Spiders. Each stands at the center of a vast conspiratorial web, with demons, spiders, and conscripted soldiers positioned between them and their enemies. Although matron mothers command great power, that power depends on maintaining the Spider Queen's favor, and the goddess sometimes capriciously takes back what she has given. The stat block here represents a matron mother at the height of her power.

A matron mother is almost never encountered alone. She is typically accompanied by a [[Rules/Source/bestiary/humanoid/drow-favored-consort-mpmm\|drow favored consort]] and a [[Rules/Source/bestiary/humanoid/drow-house-captain-mpmm\|drow house captain]], each of whom appears in this book. Other Underdark creatures might also be in the priestess's presence, providing protection or advice.

## Mothers of Rebellion

Some matron mothers renounce Lolth and join the war against their former goddess. Such drow could be of any alignment, and they lose the following abilities in the stat block: Lolth's Fickle Favor, Summon Servant, and Compel Demon. Even without these abilities, drow matron mothers are formidable opponents, and several of them hold positions of great influence in the Underdark armies arrayed against the followers of Lolth.

## A Matron Mother's Lair

The palace of a drow matron mother is her home and fortress. Sigils throughout the building allow the matron mother to use the following lair actions while within it.

Any temple of Lolth also functions as a matron mother's lair while she is inside it, unless she has renounced Lolth or another matron mother is present. When two or more matron mothers gather within a temple of their goddess, none of them can use it as their lair.

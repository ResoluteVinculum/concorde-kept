# [Ancient Copper Dragon](Rules\Source\bestiary\dragon/ancient-copper-dragon-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 80. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Ancient copper dragons use warmth and reliability to effect change over time. They open their cozy lairs to their friends as havens of learning and laughter for the young and those in need. These dragons watch for and oppose future threats while fostering sanctuaries of simple goodness.

## Copper Dragons

*Dragons of Curiosity and Community*

- **Habitat.** Hill  
- **Treasure.** [[Rules/Source/tables/random-magic-items-arcana\|Arcana]]  

Relentlessly friendly and curious, most copper dragons view the world as a place of endless wonder and possibility. These gregarious dragons are fonts of patience, hospitality, and humor, and they seek to improve the lives—or, at least, the mood—of those they interact with. If forced to fight to defend themselves or their friends, these dragons favor using their slowing breath and physical attacks to subdue antagonists. Only in cases of extreme peril or emotion do they use their deadly acid breath.

Copper dragons typically live in caverns amid picturesque hills and rock formations—particularly those that are prominent landmarks. These dragons collect gifts, though they have little interest in treasure without meaning, no matter how valuable it is. To them, thoughtfully given presents and the feelings or memories they symbolize are more important than masterpieces or magical relics.

### Copper Dragon Lairs

Copper dragons typically inhabit multi-chamber caves and renovated ruins.
